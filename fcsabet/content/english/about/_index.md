## ABOUT OUR JOURNEY

Faculty of Computer Science was founded in 2018 at Phenikaa University (former namely Thanh Tay University).  A mission of our institution is to focus on high quality educational services on computer science (CS) and information technology (IT) as well as to establish active research environments for students and staffs. We take pride in following the rigorous criteria set by ABET (Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology) to develop our programs, ensuring that our students receive a world-class education that meets global standards.
