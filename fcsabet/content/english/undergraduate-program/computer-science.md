Our Computer Science Undegraduate Program is being prepared for [ABET](https://www.abet.org/) accreditation by the Computing Accreditation Commission (CAC). In preparation for ABET accreditation, the program undergoes rigorous evaluation to ensure that it meets the established standards for quality and excellence in computer science education. This includes assessment of curriculum, faculty qualifications, student outcomes, facilities, and resources. By seeking ABET accreditation, the program demonstrates its commitment to continuous improvement and meeting the needs of students, employers, and the computing profession as a whole.


### Program Educational Objectives

* **PEO 1:** Our graduates will engage in the productive practice of implementing computer-based systems across a broad range of application areas.

* **PEO 2:** Our graduates will have successful careers in industry or academia, providing leadership for their profession.

* **PEO 3:** Our graduates will be productive and ethical professionals.

### Student Outcomes

* **1.** Analyze a complex computing problem and apply principles of computing and other relevant disciplines to identify solutions. 

* **2.** Design, implement, and evaluate a computing-based solution to meet a given set of computing requirements in the context of the program's discipline.  

* **3.** Communicate effectively in a variety of professional contexts.

* **4.** Recognize professional responsibilities and make informed judgments in computing practice based on legal and ethical principles. 

* **5.** Function effectively as a member or leader of a team engaged in activities appropriate to the program's discipline.

### Sampler of Courses

#### CSE702040 – Introduction to Computing
Explores professional, ethical, legal, security, and global issues and responsibilities in computer science related fields; also included are topics in local and global impact of computing on individuals, organizations, and society.

#### CSE703038 – Programming I 
This course aims to introduce to students the fundamentals of C programming. Basic techniques used in the declaration of data, the expressions, the branches statement, the type of loops, the definition of function, the use of pointer and the structure in C are presented. In addition, this course also orients thinking methods, programming styles, and solving simple problems in C programming language.

#### CSE703006 – Data Structure and Algorithms 
This course introduces core data structures and related algorithms. Topics include data abstraction, arrays, lists, stacks, queues, linked lists, graphs, trees, hashing, searching and sorting algorithms, and the evaluation of algorithm efficiency using big-O notations.

#### CSE702017 – Operating Systems 
Basic principles, structure, and functions of operating systems, especially UNIX. Topics include concurrency, multitasking and process synchronization, multiprogramming, and memory, processor, and device management.

#### CSE703008 – Database 
This course will provide an introductory look at database concepts, emphasizing the relational database model. The course will also illustrate concepts and application of the entity relationship diagram (ERD). Mappings from the conceptual level to the logical level, integrity constraints, dependencies, and normalization are studied as a basis for formal design. The students will understand the use of structured query language (SQL) to extract information from the database. Moreover, high-level languages, such as triggers and Stored Procedures are discussed in this course.

#### CSE703041 – Artificial Intelligence
This course explores the theoretical and practical underpinnings of artificial intelligence and provides an introductory-level AI technology
